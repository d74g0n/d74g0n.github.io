WIZARDS:
link to past times?

Quests:
earliest time::
- Village Rival Tiger Undo of WHOLLY ORDER.
    - Red Plus Symbol bards, inciting violence 'save the WHOLE land, not just parts!, that's inviting corruption!'
    - their rhetoric is a scam that causes innocent villages to kill each other; each believing the other is composed of monsters who eat children.  They are trying to restore the 'whole land' to 'POSITIVE', HEALTHY situations. (BACKWARDS DAY BEGINS);
    
    KNIGHTS = NIGHTS.
