#### d74g0n's Treasures.

Ok, so things I 'created' either from scratch or things I have taken and mutated, we can call them 'my treasures'.  They are unique datapoints.  Non-Redundant.

Do you understand what I am saying?

I am telling you, that YOU yourself... 
When you are your You-est... 
You are your most interesting.  Your most sellable.  Your most 'contibuting' to this universe.

You cannot escape your fate.
the consequences of your actions are your only destiny.


make your fate a payout.
