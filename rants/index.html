            <pre id="rant">    Ima just write down some rants; until something takes form.  Generally my ideas best unlocked by questions.  But just ranting like a madman alone will do for now until a higher structure can form.

Everything must follow the form of 'simple to complex'. We cannot have a complexity without a myriad of similicities. We cannot have a tree without a seed.

Knowing this law of the universe: "simple to complex" we can analyze any complexity by reducing it to it's simplicities. We are most conscoius about doing this in the areas of geometry; breaking down objects into their primary shapes or plutonic solids. But this same method of reduction can be applied to 'all information'.

An abstract concept that math academics toot is 'Matter is information'. It flows along the lines of; well certain types of matter are only formed in suns; so if we have a piece of that matter before us; we can deduce that it had travelled here from a supernova of sorts. How a meteor hitting earth; can be 'rewound' all the way to its 'origin' (referring to where it sat longest and some asteroid belt, before science got too strenious/bored to search further into the past)

So, our toolbox of logic is growing.
We have "simple to complex" and we have "matter is information".

How complex is the human brain? In how many ways does it sort? How detailed is it in comprehension and communication?

A human brain has undergone millions of upgrades, mutations, evolutions equating to a 'myriad of simplicites'.

A quick Aside I have to say 2 things. a) if you rip apart a seed; you will have nothing. Which is to say reduction has a point where it becomes destructive, counter productive. Nilists and black pill identities tend to frequent this zone of logic. Because they picked apart the seed and ended up with nothing; they assume all is nothing. b) d74g0n's law says every law of the universe has an exception: except this law because it is the exception. (universe cannot get stuck in infinite loops, it must mutate states.)

simple to complex.

Everything follows this universal path.

Our language; in the past; viewed from a more advanced and complex state of language over time... needs to be understood that; in the past; our language was 'less detailed' or as I call it "gisty".

If we think of a 'defined word' as a 'property' so to speak; who's area covers 'from here to here' but 'not there'... like a land property of sorts. The further back in time, the more property that word covered.

It is kinda like over population in the realm of words. After more and more words enter the field; the definitions of the properties have to shrink to fit the others; this is how 'detailed language' forms; but jostling along property lines with older words; for cuting percise definitions.

All I really want to establish; is that the older the writing; the less complex the language; eventho we are still using the same language today; in it's most uptodate form.

Science is measure. It's repeatable because it's measure based. Opinions are things used to reference something un-measured. There is no opinion in science; just ever-growing detail and accuracy of measure.

So if you ever catch yourself saying "in my opinion..." it means 'I don't know, I have no basis of measure; but here's my ignorant guess anyways", so stop yourself; and go measure what is needed.

Our word 'science' itself comes from the ancient word 'knowing'. 'knowing' means 'measured it'.

Our language evolved from simple to complex. Our brains evolved from simple to complex; together; they form eachother.

Our 'brains' our sense, could only begin at it's simplest. The concept of one grouping. one cell that could hold all the experience memories. 'everything is one' at the root of our brainseed. Something seeming to match common religious patterns.

We could call the simplest brain 'base 1', as it's sorting is 'unity'. Its basically, on with no off.

"The unary numeral system is the bijective base-1 numeral system. It is the simplest numeral system to represent natural numbers: in order to represent a number N, an arbitrarily chosen symbol representing 1 is repeated N times. This system is used in tallying."

So we could also deduce that a brain; that had only one component to group with; would only be able to count in tallying marks. Do you see the relationship?

As this simplicity goes through it's Mitosis we evolve into base-2 or binary grouping. Yin Yang. Off On, Void Matter, Gender Crotches. Dark Light, inny outty

ooph. perhaps i should talk about communication itself.

What is communication?

Well, here I am communicating to you; that you should think about communication and what it is. I almost feel like a lesson on diffusion is required but how many digressions before we become completely unintelligible? How long until i've ripped the current seed apart? I think I am on the edge right about now for my attention span.

communication is information transfer. It is diffusion from high concentration to low concentration. questions are data requests; rants are, high concentration (valid or not) diffusing to low concentration.

much of our babylonian language division is actually vernacular. like computer protocols; they all use the same internet wires; but some just don't talk to others. Even when it's all english or binary or w/e. So a 'mystics' vernacular, can really rub a listener the wrong way. I call it 'hippy dippy' talk, but there is a certain vernacular compression; a data transmission compression to parable and metaphore.

My point is; that everyone who is speaking; is diffusing. Which in some ways means their data is 'concentrate'; now someone in a cult; would have a high concentrate of.. 'their leader is awesome' and thus diffuse it to those who do not have that concentrate on that topic. Now sherlock; when someone talks; there is always valid data to be gained. If they are simply a cult member; you can realize this; and learn... they are a cult member. If they are not, spouting fiction, then you can learn what someone who has specialized on a topic has aquired, for what it is worth.

What I am saying is; listen to everybody. All the valid data that needs to be diffused is among those speaking. Those speaking in different 'vernaculars' like gangsta or cowboy or american indian, all forms of slang and grammarically correct communications... the further the vernacular from yours; the greater the data reward potential is.

All good data cancels out the bad data. Data is patterns. I call them 'valid patterns'. In-Formation. Valid patterns like, 'don't stick face in fire' because ouch. Which touches on the whole, trauma/fear based mindcontrol. Since 'information, puts us in formation', like, safely away from the fire... then when those who offer us new information, connect that information to fear and trauma, it puts us in the formation they wish. which, if someone has spent the time to position you by information; then it is not going to be to your advantage unless these people are some sorta guardian to you.

We can see things like media saying 'climate change' and in same breath saying 'world will end in 12 years'. This is trauma based information flow. Their scam is akin to someone who took you out for dinner, telling you afterwards that you injested poisons and only if you pay them, you may have the antidote. Perhaps thats a horrible metaphore for this situtaion, but i thought it so it got wrote. get wrote.

Ok nevermind the sinister applications of in-formation for now.  fundamentally our brains are the hub of our senses; what it does; is "pattern match" and from now on I will say 'mattern patch' on purpose referring to this.  Signs of how our consiousness processes the environment are clear in the perodillia experienced when observing amorpheous patterns like clouds and wood grain.  When staring at a complex pattern our simpler pattern sets fire trying to solve the puzzle.  All these things being top down survival senses; identifying eyes in the bushes may keep you alive; and having them on your wings could send a larger predator running.  If our consciousness is always searching for patterns; then this too can be abused; like eye shapes on wings, etc.  The human realm is very simple to drop home made bread crumbs for others to find and build a story from.

Interpretation and Meaning.

Meaning is a math function.  It is MEAN, as in average.  Because communication takes two to happen; the definitions; or properties of the words; never are exact in eachother heads; but the 'gist' or the 'mean average' or the 'meaning' lay in the common overlap.  'what does it mean on average' is... uh using it in the sentance that explains its mathematical relationship crystalized in our language.

The word MEAN always is a mathematical definition.  'Mean Girls' are average girls.  It is easy or be average, which is to be 'mean'. 'a mean person' is literally an average person by this comprehension.

'what does that mean' is 'what does that average out to a result'.

There is some funny things I cannot clearly outline about every idea containing its own opposite.  But aside from that; how we interpret things is always completely different from eachother; yet somehow we manage.  Because the 'meaning' is enough; the shared overlap is enough, to get a job moving the right direction.  But there is a philosophy of 'inversion' deployed by many, and because of this 'every idea contains its opposite', it because very hard to detect the inversion.

We always interpret things from our own dataset.  Which is to say; that a stranger; before they have spoken or you have even seen them; begins 'as you'.  And everything they wear or say; that you would not wear or say; or do, then slowly widdles away the differences, and they become them and not you; having a seperate dataset founded on you.  Now depending on how sociopathic you may be; you would never be able to interpret a sociopaths words in their true light.  Until you have been traumatized by them enough to suspect, rather than give 'benefit of doubt' (which is believing you wouldn't do it, so they didn't and a grand exploit of sociopaths) without another thought on the matter.

You shouldn't assume people are like you at all.  it is logically inefficient. 'through the eyes of babes' is unbais and clear sight.  Don't assume things.  Even the things you know could change at any moment; treat all truth like the weather.  Check and make sure it is still sunny out before you say it is.  If you just speak within your measured reality; you can never be wrong, growing degrees of detail being the only path of discourse; no opinions or guessing.  Pure measure to ever highering degree.

There is no 'agree to disagree'.  Think about gravity.  It is or isn't, and because we know it is... we can measure it's rate.  There is no 'agree to disagree' about gravity; there is comprhension and dismissial of comprehension.  Those who say such things; are dismissing the comprehension.  It is always a measure; if you are dealing with reality. knowing is having measured.  Universe is binary at core; things did or did not happen.  The unique identifier of all data in the universe is 'space-time' as no 2 things happened in the same space-time. So sherlock, at core; the truth is tied to a measure at a specific space and time.  But if you think about this; you already function on this level of spatial geometry.  If you tell your friend to meet you somewhere specific without a time, the message it practically meaningless.

When does the sheep dog bark?  From the perspective of the sheep mind you.  You can tell where the freedom is; because it is 'beyond the barks'.

when I say 'matter is information' that means all matter by mere existence has an inference of causality to how it became to be.  It does not mean; that immeasurable things are lacking information.  But ideals are weapons of cult leaders and exploitation; chasing an ideal always results in 'liquidation' of the ideal embracer.

crystalization in fact.

The crystal represents the goal of structure; the most rigid and strong form so to speak.  If you watch a dog poo, then someone takes that poo and tries to tell you it is a chocolate bar; there is no way you can be convinced having seen it's production.  You saw the measure of its making; and now, no matter how much someone claims facts otherwise, or applies to your ethics 'your bad bigot if you don't eat this' or application to pathos feels like 'the children will suffer if you don't eat it'... still does not cancel out the fact it is verified dog poo that you arn't eating.  This is being 'crystalized in fact'.  The christo's persay.  christ-alization.  Do you see the harmony of form here?  Is your mattern patcher working good enough?

Abstract concepts.

All that the brain does is pattern match.  Clouds and perodillia etc.  Now what is intellect?  Is it a vast dataset of patterns absorbed?  Is it how the small patterns come together to form larger patterns.  How computer science converged with the fields of biology to create a field called artificial intelligence?  How smaller simpler patterns converge in harmony with eachother to form a more complex pattern.  How a wheel and an engine alone are neat but when put together can drive us through a loopdeloop, being much more than the sum of it's individual parts in measured excitement.  

Abstraction is a 'higher viewpoint'.  I simply associate it with 'larger patterns' which is to say 'complex patterns' as they are composed of two or more simple patterns connected. Very much like getting a 'higher view' so to speak. Drugs like lsd, and other hallucenogenic drugs are in many cases how the artist chases abstractions.  Because the methods inducing 'sensory short circuits' generally are damaging in nature; too much abstraction chasing can do more damage than good.  Anciently things like 'talking in tongues' were the pseudo-random sound generator that allowed for random 'reccognizable things' to be plucked from the audio record.  Or funny sounds etc that make us all giggle, much healthier than taking posions regularily.  Gibberish noises etc, all play their part in, triggering abstract pattern recognition.
