Was chatting with a fren, they said I should do a podcast because 'i have to get my message out'. But my message is nothing more than pure logic. It is not 'mine' by any means; Does the weather man own the weather? Nah he just looks and reports the measure.

What is the measure of logic?

I better start at the beginning of reasoning.
